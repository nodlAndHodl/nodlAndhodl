### Welp That Went Different Than I Anticipated
So the Executive Order for creating a strategic reserve was signed yesterday. That went differently than I thought. I've read a bit of it, and the USA will be creating a reserve with the Bitcoin it has from DOJ seizures. The interesting thing I is the mention of increasing these reserves in a neutral way so as to not create a burden on the US taxpayer. In other words from other seizures, selling of other government assets(gold?), and or selling the crypto it has also acquired? 

It did effectively separate Bitcoin from crypto and that this EO will not seek to accumulate shitcoins. Which in my opinion if the US Federal Government is going to do this, it is prefereable to acquiring XRP/SOL/ETH etc. 
### Will the Reserve Have Shitcoins?
I am still a bit murky on those details. It might be that they simply sell whatever crypto assets other than Bitcoin to purchase more of the Orange Coin. Might be they just hold on to them. But either way it seems like they will not be acquiring or attempting to acquire anything other than Bitcoin. 

### The Window
It's a yuuge shift in the overton window though. Sometimes there are years where nothing happens and sometimes there are moments where years happen.
