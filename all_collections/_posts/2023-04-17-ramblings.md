### Getting Started Writing

This is going to be my first actual post. I have been hosting my own [nostr NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) for a few months now on this site, and this site was originally started to be a way for me to get my ramblings out to the world. 

I am not going to make any proclamations about writing on here everyday, or what the content is likely to be entirely. 
My hope is to write more about Bitcoin and NOSTR and things that I find of interest, whether tangential or not to the previous topics. Not sure entirely, but I think I'll go over my initial introduction to Bitcoin in 2013'ish and my adventures in  ðŸ’©coins and why I don't do that anymore. 

I am always looking to connect with other plebs and my DM's are always open for good conversation.
