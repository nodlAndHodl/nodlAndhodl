### Starting a Business is Not Easy
I had a chat with a career coach today. It's not going to be easy to start something new. It's work. It's going to be hard.
it requires breaking habits that I have formed. Some are not so good. I am great at procrastination. 
### The Reward
The reward is freedom though. There is no other way. There are some who think that luck happens to people, but I think it's what happens to those who prepare for it. I am tired of not preparing for it. Bring on the change.
